# MediFund – Decentralized Medical Crowdfunding

## Introduction

MediFund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built to provide secure, transparent, and accessible financial assistance for medical treatments. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, MediFund connects patients in need with donors globally, ensuring that every donation is traceable and directly transferred to healthcare providers.

## Features

- **Decentralized and Transparent**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency for donors and recipients.
- **Secure**: Smart contracts ensure that funds are released only to approved hospitals upon campaign completion.
- **Global Donations**: Donors from around the world can contribute to life-saving medical campaigns.
- **Integration with MetaMask**: Easy wallet connection using MetaMask for seamless transactions.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live tracking of donation progress for each campaign.
- **Multi-Cryptocurrency Support**: Using **Wormhole SDK**, multiple cryptocurrencies are accepted.
  
## Why MediFund?

MediFund addresses the gaps in healthcare funding by creating a secure and efficient platform for medical donations, particularly useful in regions like Southeast Asia, where access to healthcare and funding is often limited.

### Key Benefits:
- Transparency in donations.
- Bridging the gap in healthcare funding for underprivileged communities.
- Safe, secure, and global accessibility to raise funds.

## How it Works

1. **Create a Campaign**: Patients or hospitals can create campaigns, detailing the medical need, cost, and goal.
2. **Approve Campaigns**: Hospitals verify and approve campaigns related to their care.
3. **Donate**: Donors can contribute using cryptocurrency (e.g., ETH) via MetaMask or WalletConnect.
4. **Funds Released**: Once the campaign reaches its goal, funds are released to the hospital for the patient’s treatment.

## Smart Contract Details

The MediFund platform is powered by a smart contract built using Solidity, ensuring secure and automated transactions. The contract manages campaigns, donations, and fund distribution.
